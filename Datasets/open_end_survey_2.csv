Make events (learning, games, movies, summer camps/meals) that grasps the youths attention along with the parents to encourage the parents to send their youth to the facility."

It feels a bit run down but with potential not sure why it doesn‚Äôt integrate in someway with Rosewood rec for programs or other.

Community Needs,"If you answered ""Does not meet needs"" to the previous question, why do you feel that the MYEC does not meet the needs of youth in Austin, particularly East Austin?",Most of the technology in the building is outdated. The managment of the facility does not relate to current youth interest. The space is not utilized to the benefit of the community. It should be opperated and administrated by a local black non profit and funded by the city. The city parks department has neglected the site from a administrative and managment perspective. The city has historically underfunded the operations and maintenance of the facility. Classic case of the consistent practices undervaluing the black community by the local government.

There is little to no marketing for youth events/activities at the MYEC for/to those who live in the community. Having a BOGO (buy one, get one FREE on tickets) or FREE Day (limit/cap of per person cost/expense) from time to time or at least once a month would help financially challenged families to participate and have an outing to plan and look forward to - like the FREE museum days offered.

General,What areas of the MYEC need to be (can be) enhanced or  improved?,"I haven't been to the MYEC in over 3 years but I feel based on my last visit that the quality of entertainment needs to increase into something that's more stimulating visually and host more teen oriented events possibly scheduled weekly or monthly. Overall, I feel MYEC needs a remodel geared toward this generation. The center seems to have the same energy when I went  there for teen dances during my middle school years in the 2000's when it first opened. I still believe the purpose of the center is highly relevant but the packaging needs some re-wrapping. I'm a teen activity specialist at Gus Garcia and my focus is to make sure our teens are occupied with positive activities and MYEC is somewhere I would what to have them attend soon."

I think these people would come back and provide more local business/traffic to support the MYEC.  We would love for the movie theatre to be back so we could watch movies there.
